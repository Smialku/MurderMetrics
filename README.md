Murder Rate Dashboard
Project Description
This project analyzes murder rates across different U.S. states and visualizes the data using Dash and Plotly. The goal is to explore the relationship between crime statistics (specifically murder rates) and population data, creating clear and interactive visuals that help users understand crime patterns by state.

Key Features:
Data Analysis: Basic statistical calculations including mean, median, and quantile for both population and murder rates.
Interactive Visualizations: Various charts such as box plots, histograms, pie charts, and density plots that allow for easy comparison of data across states.
Interactive Dashboard: A web-based dashboard created with Dash where users can dynamically explore the data and gain insights.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
Dash: For building the interactive web dashboard.
Matplotlib: For static charts and additional visualizations.
